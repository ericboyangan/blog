Welcome to the blog! I've yet to figure out most things here, but preliminarily I hope to use it to compile three categories of things I delight in occasionally coming across: puzzles/brainteasers, little snippets of math, and (aspirationally) creative writing. I'll expound on these in a forthcoming ["About" section]({% link about.markdown %}), but for now, enjoy one of my all-time favorite probability puzzles!

### Puzzle: Guessing all dice
\\(100\\) statisticians will play a game in which each simultaneously rolls a fair \\(6\\)-sided dice, but each sees only the result of the \\(99\\) other dice rolls (and not their own). Simultaneously and without further communication, each guesses their own roll, and the group wins iff every guess is correct. What strategy maximizes the group's chance of success (and what is that chance)?
