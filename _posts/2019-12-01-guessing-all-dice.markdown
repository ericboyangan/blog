100 statisticians will play a game in which each simultaneously rolls a fair 6-sided dice, but each sees only the result of the 99 other dice rolls (and not their own). Simultaneously and without further communication, each guesses their own roll, and the group wins iff every guess is correct. What strategy maximizes the group's chance of success (and what is that chance)?
