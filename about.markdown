Just a little place to jot down a few of my favorite things:
* Puzzles, problems, and brainteasers, of the sort you might encounter during a fun, [but bad, job interview](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/why-brainteasers-dont-belong-in-job-interviews)
* Notes from my occasional attempts to learn/re-learn some bit of mathematics
* Helpful snippets of code / commands accrued through my career in engineering & data science

Although the blog is primarily for my own benefit, hopefully its contents are also helpful or interesting to you!

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
